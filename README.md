# Building A Custom HTML5 Video Player Using TailwindCSS and JavaScript

**HTML5 comes equipped with a native video player. It's shipped with a simple user interface, functionality, and some basic controls in the browser. And while the functionality of the default video player via the browser works perfectly, the user interface isn't so beautiful and fancy, and it's just not generally aesthetically pleasing.**

For this reason, most modern web applications and platforms like Udemy, Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime don't ship the default built-in HTML5 video player to their users. Instead, they build their own customized versions with a sleek user interface to make their platforms more attractive and user-friendly.
